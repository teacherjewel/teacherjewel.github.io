    <p>There are many ups and downs to every career, which makes it hard to choose. The idea of missed oppurtunities or mistakes can be frightening, and we have to make this decision very early in our lives. Luckily we know what we're good at, and have an idea of what we enjoy by the time we enter our 20's. In the event that teacher is one of your possibilties, hopefully this will prove helpful.</p>
    
    <p>As you can see on the education page, there's a lot of schooling going towards this career which means a lot of possible student debt. There are ways around student debt, but this isn't the page for that. You're going to be a government employee with what I consider one of the most important jobs you can have; educating the future generations. Down below I'll list what I consider pros and cons, you don't need to agree with them.</p>
