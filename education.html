    <p>This is a seemingly short list, but it takes a lot of time. Public school takes 13 years including kindergarten. I think the fastest you could get a teaching certificate or whatever it's called is 5 years. Remember, college is exspensive and the pay for this isn't going to afford you any super cars.</p>
